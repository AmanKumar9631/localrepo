                    Having demonstrated remarkable resilience through recent crises, nonprofits are reimagining their roles in a rapidly changing world. With limited time and resources, they are eager to adopt more strategic approaches that amplify their impact. Grounded in robust research and data analysis, we have made significant contributions in program and policy designs across the globe. This practice team supports in designing strategies and implementation plans along with facilitation of consultations with various stakeholders, including government bodies, civil society, and communities for inclusive program or policy formulation.

  <p>Many nonprofits operate with constrained budgets, limiting their ability to invest in advanced data systems, technologies, or specialised talent. As a result, they often rely on self-reported or external data sources, which can be inconsistent or incomplete. Integrating data from various platforms—such as surveys, CRM systems, and field reports—can also be technically challenging. We help social impact organisations unlock the full potential of their data, combining internal and publicly available sources to assess program success and scalability. Our support to clients include: descriptive analytics to identify trends and performance patterns, prescriptive analytics to guide strategic decisions, predictive analytics to forecast future outcomes, and scale for impact using tools like Social Return on Investment (SROI), cost-effectiveness analysis, and Results-Based Management (RBM). This comprehensive approach enables organisations to make informed, data-driven decisions and maximise their impact.</p>
